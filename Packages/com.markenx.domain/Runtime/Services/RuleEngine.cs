/// The engine applies formulas ("rules") that transform raw attributes such as 
/// age, income, or personality traits into numerical dimensions used by the 
/// consumer model (e.g., PriceSensitivity, SocialRecognition).
///
/// This keeps dimension calculation flexible: each rule is independent and 
/// no hard-coded conditional logic (if/else per dimension) is required. 
/// New dimensions can be added simply by registering new rules.

  /// Rules used:
  /// - SocialRecognition: modeled by age, assuming younger individuals tend to
  ///   have stronger social-recognition needs. The result is normalized to [0,1].
  ///
  /// - PriceSensitivity: inversely related to income. Lower income yields higher 
  ///   sensitivity to price. The result is clamped to [0,1].
  ///
  /// These rules are intentionally simple examples; the real system can expand 
  /// them or register alternate formulas without modifying the RuleEngine logic.
